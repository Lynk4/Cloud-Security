#  Perimeter Leak 

---

 After weeks of exploits and privilege escalation you've gained access to what 
you hope is the final server that you can then use to extract out the secret flag 
from an S3 bucket.

It won't be easy though. The target uses an AWS data perimeter to restrict access 
to the bucket contents.

Good luck!
